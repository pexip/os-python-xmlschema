   This license was applied to software published by W3C before 13 May, 2015.
   On 13 May, 2015, W3C adopted a revised and renamed "software and document"
   license and applied the new license to all W3C documents that had
   previously been made available under this license. The new license grants
   all permissions that had been granted under this 2002 license.

 This version: http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document
 .
 Previous version: http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-software-20021231

 This version makes clear that the license is applicable to both software and
 text, by changing the name and substituting "work" for instances of "software
 and its documentation." It moves "notice of changes or modifications to the
 files" to the copyright notice, to make clear that the license is compatible
 with other liberal licenses.
